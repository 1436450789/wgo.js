# Welcome in WGo.js 3.0.0-alpha #

This branch is a preparation for WGo.js library of version 3. Currently it contains `WGo.Board` and `WGo.Game` modules from the master branch (v2) but ready to be rewritten from the scratch ;-)

![WGo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waltheri/wgo.js/dev/docs-src/wgo.png)

## What you can look forward to ##

* SVG board with cool animations as counterpart to the HTML5 canvas board
* Custom player templates 
* And much more...

## Installation ##

With node.js:

```
npm install wgo
```

Or you can directly download minified script files from the `/dist` directory.

## Build ##

If you edit any source file you will probably want to rebuild main script and its minified version. This procedure is also required for pull requests.

```
npm run build
```

## Documentation ##

Full documentation can be found [here](http://waltheri.github.io/wgo.js/).
