{"name":"Wgo.js","tagline":"","body":"_Under construction_\r\n\r\n### What is WGo.js\r\n\r\nWGo.js is javascript library for purposes of go game. The basic idea of this library is to help to create go web application easily without laborious programming of game's logic or board graphic interface. It is descendant of WGoApi and we can say WGo.js is second version of this library. I decided to remove word 'Api' from the name and add suffix '.js' as is common for javascript libraries. But in texts I use shortly WGo.\r\n\r\n## WGo.js contains two main components:\r\n\r\nBoard - graphical go board implemented in HTML5 canvas. It has extensive API for easy manipulation. You can add and remove predefined objects like stones on board, you can create your own objects, or even make cut-outs of board.\r\nGame - object for storing of game's position and controling game's flow. With method \"play\" you can play move and create new position with rules applied.\r\n\r\nWGo is written in javascript with help of HTML5 and WGo applications should work fine in all new browsers, even on Androids and iPhones. \r\nUnfortunately it won't work on Internet Explorer 8 and lower, because of absence of canvas element, which is crucial for drawing of a board. \r\n\r\nWGo.js also comes with powerfull go player, or more precisely sgf game viewer, which can be embedded into websites. This player is designed to be unlimitedly extendable.\r\n\r\nYou can find more info here: http://wgo.waltheri.net/\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Test of javascript code\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Main namespace - it initializes WGo in first run and then execute main function. \r\n * You must call WGo.init() if you want to use library, without calling WGo.\r\n */\r\n \r\nvar WGo = {\r\n\t// basic information\r\n\tversion: \"2.3.1\",\r\n\t\r\n\t// constants for colors (rather use WGo.B or WGo.W)\r\n\tB: 1,\r\n\tW: -1,\r\n\r\n\t// if true errors will be shown in dialog window, otherwise they will be ignored\r\n\tERROR_REPORT: true,\r\n\tDIR: mydir,\r\n\t\r\n\t// Language of player, you can change this global variable any time.
